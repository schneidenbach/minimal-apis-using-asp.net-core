# Minimal APIs using ASP.NET Core

## Project overview

The project contains a simple solution that compares controllers, minimal APIs, and minimal APIs using route groups. The route groups also contains typed results - both are included together as they are features in .NET 7.

For the folks who are curious about the performance between the 3 methods, run the app with the `--benchmark` switch. Ensure you change your build configuration to Release. I don't really know how helpful this is - multiple runs pretty much confirm that they perform pretty much the same.
